# Integrating TAO Models in a DeepStream Pipeline

In this repository, we take pre-trained models via Nvidia TAO (available via NGC) and integrate them in a DeepStream pipeline. Our [sample video](videos/sample_720p.h264), upon which the inference engine is run, is a video captured from a busy road on a a clear day with lots of cars and people in the frame. There are two notebooks available in the [Notebooks](notebooks/) section, one on running a primary inference engine on the video(referred to as PGIE in DeepStream), to detect vehicles and people in each frame. In the second notebook, we run a secondary classifier engine(SGIE) along with our primary detector engine, which works on every deteacted object identified as a 'Car' to identify what kind of vehicle(sedan, suv, truck, etc) it is. The models we use are TrafficCamNet for PGIE and VehicleTypeNet for SGIE. The essential libraries used in  these notebooks are stored in the [source_code](source_code/) section, and should not be touched until more necessary files are required.
